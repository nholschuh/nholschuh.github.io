title: Geophysics and Glaciology at Amherst College
description: The Holschuh Lab at Amherst College supports students in geology, physics, math, and computer science who are interested in studying the climate system. Together, we study glacier change using observational geophysics (light, sound, and gravity). Learn more about our work here.

		<h1>Welcome to  Amherst College Glaciology</h1>

		<td style='padding-right: 80px; '><p>Hello from the Holschuh lab! Our work integrates remote sensing, modeling, and field measurements to better understand the fate of ice in a changing climate. And while our main focus is the past, present, and future of Earth's Ice Sheets,  that work connects Antarctica and Greenland to local field sites here in Massachusetts which have been reshaped by ice throughout Earth's history.

		<p>Research done in the Holschuh Lab supports several major ongoing research initiatives. Learn more about those initiatives using the links to their individual websites below. These projects have each provided funding for research at Amherst.</p>

		<p> Our research typically involves the use of ice penetrating radar data. Radar measures backscattered energy from both within and below glacier systems. The animation below captures the basis for radar measurements.</p>
