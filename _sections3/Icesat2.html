<h2>Diagnosing Subsurface Dynamics from Surface Height Change</h2>

Transient subsurface processes are expressed at the surface in the form of velocity and elevation changes. Much of west Antarctica is thinning in response to warm water intrusions in the Amundsen Sea, while parts of East Antarctica and the Siple Coast are thickening in response to changes in ice dynamics and surface mass balance. Using ICESat-2 data, I link subsurface processes with observed surface change to better understand the ice-flow regimes across Antarctica and Greenland.
