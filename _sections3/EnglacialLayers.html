		Spatially variable flow rates leave a record in the internal structure of the ice, detectable using radar. As the ice flows over either resistive or lubricated beds, it compresses or stretches, leaving characteristic synformal and antiformal structures in the internal layers of the ice sheet. While challenging to interpret, these structures are some of the few data that directly reflect the frictional resistance of the system, and have the potential to inform our understanding of the basal boundary conditions. One goal of my research is to be able to use measurable features in these structures to invert for the frictional characteristics at the bed. Working toward this objective involves observational studies (collecting and examining radar data over areas of known or expected variability in the bed properties) as well as modeling exercises (cataloging the suite of possible and expected internal structures). The Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica is a perfect area to test this method, as the frictional properties of the system are thought to be geologically controlled, and therefore spatially and temporally stable over the glacial cycle.
