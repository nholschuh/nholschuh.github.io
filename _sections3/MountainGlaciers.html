Improved instrumentation makes it possible to map glacier speeds at high frequencies over large areas. Using a GAMMA Ground-based, portable, radar interferometer (GPRi), we take 2 minute repeat measures of the glacier speed in an effort to evaluate diurnal variations in ice flow during the melt season. These data are calibrated against GPS observations on ice, and provide some of the first 2D maps of glacier flow on a minute-by-minute basis in the North Cascades.
