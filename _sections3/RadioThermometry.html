The conductivity of ice is primarily controlled by two properties: its temperature and chemistry. When ice is warm or impurity rich, it has an elevated conductivity, resulting in additional power losses as energy carried by the electromagnetic wave is dissipated as current. For reflection radioglaciology surveys, it is difficult to disentangle power losses during propagation from power losses during reflection, limiting our ability to infer ice and reflector property information from radar data alone. In my research, I am looking into other data sources that can aid in inferring ice conductivity, and therefore temperature. Current work attempts to use surface velocity information (derived from InSAR observations of the ice sheet surface) to constrain  thermal gradients in the ice sheets (based on work done during shear and longitudinal strain), to ultimately inform an inverse problem for spatially variable attenuation in radar data.
